# my_bc

This project takes a classical approach to implement a clone of bc, in essence bc is in its own right a programming language, therefore, this implementation covers all the required steps in order to give sense to an input string with an algebraic expression "1 + 2 * (3 - 42) % 5" to an Output 3, solving the Mathematical expression along the way, many foundational Computer science subjects are covered, stacks, queues, and Binary trees are used to implement this program.
